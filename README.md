# Portafolio Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository page, where I showcase my portfolio of projects as a data analyst. I am an Industrial Engineer with a postgraduate degree in Supply Chain Management, and I am passionate about leveraging data to gain valuable insights and drive informed decision-making.

Within this repository, you will find a collection of projects that highlight my proficiency in various technologies and tools commonly used in the data analysis field. I have extensive experience working with Excel, SQL (PostgreSQL and pgAdmin4), Tableau, Google Data Studio, Python, R, Jupyter Notebooks, and Anaconda. Additionally, I am well-versed in data manipulation and analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Feel free to explore my projects, delve into the code, and examine the visualizations and reports I have created. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, please do not hesitate to reach out. I am always open to engaging in exciting data-driven projects and expanding my knowledge in this ever-evolving field.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub repository page, and I look forward to sharing my work with you.
